# NASA Nearest Earth Objects (NEO) Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the NASA Nearest Earth Objects (NEO) dataset, which contains detailed information about celestial bodies and asteroids that come close to Earth's orbit. The primary objective of this project is to:

1. **Analyze NEO Dataset:** Extract meaningful insights and patterns from the dataset regarding the characteristics and behaviors of these near-Earth objects.
2. **Predict Danger Levels:** Develop a machine learning model to predict how dangerous these asteroids could be to Earth based on their features.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn


### Running the Analysis

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Run the data preprocessing notebook to clean and prepare the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Use the EDA notebook to explore the dataset, visualize patterns, and understand the key features.
3. **Model Training:** Train the predictive models using the provided scripts or notebooks.
4. **Prediction and Evaluation:** Evaluate the models' performance and predict the danger levels of asteroids.

## Results

The results folder contains the output of the analysis, including:

- Visualizations of the data
- Performance metrics of the models
- Predictions on the test set
